So you want to make games, right? +
Basically, every computer program (yes, games are also included) are made using a *programming language*. But what is it?
Similarly when we want to talk to someone from another country and we choose a common language between the two, a programming language is a language in which both humans and computers understand. This is how we tell the computer what it should do. +

In this first world, we will study the basics of Lua programming language, which we use to make games using the LÃ–VE framework.
