=== Introduction

So you want to make games, right? +
Basically, every computer program (yes, games are also included) are made using a *programming language*. But what is it?
Similarly when we want to talk to someone from another country and we choose a common language between the two, a programming language is a language in which both humans and computers understand. This is how we tell the computer what it should do. +
Computer programs are basically a bunch of instructions that a programmer wrote and distributed. Thus, the computer will follow the instructions' guide and begin to perform them.

In this first world, we will study the basics of Lua programming language, which we use to make games using the LÃ–VE framework.

=== What is Lua?

Lua is a simple, light and extremely powerful language, designed to be used within complex software (such as games). It was created by a team of developers of PUC-Rio, Brazil. And because of its efficiency, extreme clarity and *ease of learning*, came to be used in various applications.
