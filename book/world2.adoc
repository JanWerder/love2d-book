[[world2]]
== The Redo

So that was <<world1>>. In the last few levels we went from our idea to an actual playable game... so what's left to do?

Well, it turns out there is _a lot!_

Even though the game so far is perfectly playable, some of the code has gotten messy during the development process.
Also we haven't added any real art, sound effects or menu yet - everything that makes your game visually appealing to users is missing.
This is because in <<world1>> we only created a _prototype_, a smaller version of the game to explore the concepts we want to be in our final game.
Now it's time to take a step further and build *the _actual_ game*... +
So lets *redo* this thing!
